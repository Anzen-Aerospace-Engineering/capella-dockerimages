    description: 'Clean all test docker containers'

# To address the issue of legacy or remaining containers resulting from a cancelled
# or timed-out pipeline, we require an additional CI template. This is because
# the "after_script" keyword in GitLab only works for successful job cases,
# but not for unsuccessful ones. This is particularly relevant when we cancel
# a pipeline while running the Pytests, which can lead to leftover containers.
# Although there is some ongoing work to tackle this issue, it may only apply to
# the cancelled job case. We are keeping an eye on this development,
# which can be followed at: https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/387230.
# When this feature becomes available, we might consider switching over to it.
